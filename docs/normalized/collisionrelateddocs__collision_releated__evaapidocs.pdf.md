     Overview 
The Sentry API facilitates the secure and efficient transmission of data related to 
vehicles involved in Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) or other forms of damage that 
require engineering assessment, reporting, or authorization. 
This API enables authorized external partners - such as insurers, claims management 
companies, and repair networks - to exchange claim-related data quickly and reliably. 

   Supported Data Types 
The Sentry API supports the transmission and management of the following data types: 
•           Instructions - details and requests relating to the handling of a vehicle claim. 
•    Notes - internal or external commentary related to a claim’s progress or 
observations. 
•     Claim Updates - status changes, progress updates, and lifecycle events. 
•     Location Updates - geolocation or tracking information relevant to the 
vehicle or case. 
•    Repair Authority Updates - communication of repair authorizations, 
amendments, or rejections. 

       Purpose 
The Sentry API is designed to make the process of sending and receiving vehicle claim-
related data: 
• Quick - streamlined data exchange between systems. 
• Efficient - minimal manual intervention or duplication. 
• Simple to Integrate - clear structure and straightforward implementation for any 
external service provider.

     Authentication 
All Sentry API endpoints require valid authentication using a JSON Web Token (JWT). 
External users must first obtain a token using their assigned Client ID and Client 
Secret credentials. 
Tokens are short-lived and must be refreshed periodically. 

  Authentication Endpoint 
POST /Connect/token 

     Request Format 
The request must use the application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type and 
include the following fields: 
Field Type Required Description 
Client_Id string    Yes Unique identifier assigned to the client. 
Client_Secret string    Yes Secret key assigned to the client for 
authentication. 

       Example Request 
POST /api/Connect/token 
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 

Client_Id=partner123&Client_Secret=secretKeyValue

     Example Responses 
   Success (200 OK) 
{ 
  "access_token": "JWT string" , 
  "expires_in": 5 
} 
• access_token: The JWT string used for authenticating subsequent requests. 
• expires_in: Time remaining (in minutes) before the token expires (default: 5 
minutes). 
  Failure (401 Unauthorized) 
{ 
  "error": "unauthorized_client" , 
  "error_description": "Invalid Client ID or Secret" 
} 

        Usage 
All subsequent API requests must include the token in the HTTP Authorization header: 
Authorization: Bearer {access_token} 

    Tip: Because tokens expire every 5 minutes, it’s recommended to automate token 
refreshes using your integration middleware or API client.
