# Salvage Benchmarking

## Concept

Build a controlled salvage-value benchmarking dataset from CE historical total-loss cases, EVA report outputs, and approved salvage auction or commercial data sources.

## Why it matters

The Phase 5 plan identifies salvage auction prices as a useful benchmark. This is particularly relevant for total-loss or near-total-loss assessments where salvage value and disposal value are part of the financial position.

The Sentry/EVA report documentation includes valuation fields such as market, retail, trade, mid-point, salvage and disposal values. If CE can retrieve released reports and store those fields historically, CE can build its own internal salvage intelligence even before purchasing external auction data.

## Data sources

### Internal

- EVA/Sentry released reports.
- CE historical total-loss cases.
- Engineer report values.
- Repair estimate totals.
- vehicle age/mileage/fuel/category.
- damage category and impact area.

### External/commercial

- salvage auction feeds where licensed;
- commercial vehicle history/valuation providers;
- insurer/client-provided salvage outcomes.

## Use cases

### 1. Salvage reasonableness review

Flag if proposed salvage value is materially outside historical CE ranges for similar vehicles and damage profiles.

### 2. Total-loss pack support

Provide engineer with comparable salvage values and source evidence.

### 3. Supplier/client trend analysis

Identify how salvage values differ by principal, vehicle segment, age, damage type and time period.

### 4. Settlement challenge support

Where a salvage deduction is challenged, provide a transparent evidence summary.

## Data model

```sql
salvage_evidence(
  case_id,
  normalised_vrm,
  vehicle_make,
  vehicle_model,
  first_registration_year,
  mileage,
  damage_zone,
  claim_type,
  market_value,
  salvage_value,
  salvage_percentage_of_market,
  source,
  source_date,
  evidence_reference
)
```

## Implementation approach

1. Mine existing EVA reports for salvage and valuation fields.
2. Store total-loss and repair/disposal outcomes.
3. Build simple comparable search by make/model/age/fuel/body/value band.
4. Only then consider external auction integrations.

## Controls

- External auction data is likely commercial; confirm licence before storing or reusing.
- Salvage comparables should be evidence, not automatic conclusion.
- Avoid overfitting from small samples.
- Record whether values are estimates, actual sale outcomes, or report opinions.

## MVP

Build an internal CE salvage comparables dashboard using historical reports only. This produces value without waiting for external feed procurement.
