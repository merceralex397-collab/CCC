# Weather Context Enrichment

## Concept

Add weather context to cases using the incident date, time and location where available.

## Why this may help

Weather context can support factual case understanding: wet roads, heavy rain, freezing conditions, low visibility or strong winds may be relevant to accident circumstances. The Phase 5 plan correctly identifies weather as a potential contextual dataset.

## Important caveat

Do not overstate weather data. Public Weather DataHub observation endpoints may have limited historical range for recent observations. Older accident dates may require:

- an archive product;
- a commercial arrangement;
- a local capture process started prospectively;
- alternative open climate datasets where suitable.

## Inputs

- incident date;
- incident time if present;
- incident location/postcode/coordinates if present;
- inspection address if incident location is missing;
- claim circumstances text;
- nearest weather station.

## Data sources

- Met Office Weather DataHub observations for recent data.
- Met Office DataHub forecast/site-specific products for forward-looking scheduling contexts.
- Met Office climate data portal or other historical sources for older context, subject to licence and suitability.

## Outputs

```json
{
  "weather_context": {
    "available": true,
    "source": "met_office_observation",
    "nearest_station": "...",
    "distance_km": 12.4,
    "observation_time": "2026-04-14T15:00:00Z",
    "summary": "Rain observed near incident time.",
    "parameters": {
      "precipitation": "...",
      "temperature": "...",
      "wind_speed": "..."
    },
    "confidence": "medium"
  }
}
```

## Use cases

### 1. Engineer pack context

Add a factual note:

> Weather data near the reported incident time indicates rain in the area. This is contextual only and has not been used as a conclusion.

### 2. Claim circumstances consistency

If the accident circumstances mention heavy rain but available weather context shows dry conditions at the nearest observation point, flag for human review, not rejection.

### 3. Inspection scheduling

Use forecast data to help schedule physical inspections or travel-heavy work.

### 4. Operational analysis

Track claim volume and severity patterns against weather periods, but only after controlling for seasonal and geographic effects.

## Implementation

1. Geocode incident location or postcode.
2. Find nearest appropriate observation source.
3. Query/capture weather around incident time.
4. Store raw response and derived summary.
5. Surface only concise context in case pack.

## Controls

- Weather data does not prove causation.
- Never use weather alone to make a liability or fraud conclusion.
- Track uncertainty from missing incident time/location.
- Store source/time/station/distance.

## MVP

Start with a manual or semi-automated enrichment for cases where incident date/time/location are known. Do not attempt full historical reconstruction until a suitable historical weather source is confirmed.
