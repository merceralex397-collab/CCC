# Prior Total Loss and Previous Claim Review

## Concept

Use CE historical case data, EVA reports, VRM notes and approved vehicle history sources to flag vehicles with prior total-loss or prior claim indicators for review.

## Internal basis

The EVA User Guide says staff should use `Eng Notes on Vehicle` when the vehicle is a previous total loss, and must verify that the previous total-loss date is not the same or very similar to the current accident date. That is exactly the kind of process that should be supported by a bulk data layer.

## Use cases

### 1. Same-VRM historical CE case search

When a new instruction arrives, search CE history for the same VRM:

- previous reports;
- previous valuations;
- previous damage zones;
- previous images;
- previous claim dates;
- previous total-loss notes.

### 2. Prior total-loss date sanity check

If a vehicle is marked previous total loss, compare previous loss date with current incident date. If they are close, flag that the note may refer to the current case, not a prior case.

### 3. Damage recurrence review

If previous damage zone is similar to current damage zone, present prior evidence to engineer.

### 4. Duplicate current claim detection

Same VRM + similar date + same principal/reference pattern may indicate duplicate instruction or duplicate report workflow.

## Output language

Avoid making allegations. Use neutral review prompts:

> Previous CE case found for same VRM. Review previous report and images before finalising current assessment.

> Prior total-loss note date appears close to current incident date. Confirm whether this relates to the current case or a previous event.

## Data sources

- CE case database.
- EVA/Sentry report retrieval.
- CE Document Mapper exports.
- image metadata and image similarity results.
- approved commercial vehicle history data, where licensed.

## Implementation

### Matching keys

- normalised VRM;
- claim reference;
- date of loss;
- claimant/client name where lawful and necessary;
- image hashes;
- document checksums;
- EVA reference.

### Review pack

Create a `prior_case_review_pack` containing:

- prior case dates;
- report type;
- damage zone summary;
- valuation/salvage values;
- image thumbnails or links;
- notes;
- confidence score.

## Controls

- Do not auto-label fraud.
- Limit personal data shown in prior-case comparisons.
- Maintain audit trail when staff open/use prior evidence.
- Avoid showing irrelevant old case data to users who do not need it.

## MVP

Start with internal CE history only:

1. same VRM search;
2. current vs previous incident date comparison;
3. previous total-loss flag;
4. link to prior report/evidence.

External history providers can be layered later.
