# Market Valuation Evidence Store

## Concept

Create an evidence store for valuation lookups from approved sources such as Glass's/Autovista, Auto Trader, Cazana/Percayso or other licensed valuation providers.

## Why this matters

The EVA User Guide says valuation currently uses VRM, mileage and incident date in Glass's and Percayso, then carries selected retail/trade values into the EVA valuation tab. The project planning notes also treat valuation as evidence-gathering, not an automatic final valuation.

A market valuation evidence store allows CE to keep a defensible trail of what was checked, when, against which mileage and vehicle assumptions.

## Data captured

For every valuation lookup:

```json
{
  "case_id": "WI-2026-000123",
  "normalised_vrm": "AB12CDE",
  "valuation_source": "glass_autovista",
  "lookup_time": "2026-05-22T12:00:00Z",
  "incident_date_used": "2026-04-14",
  "mileage_used": 53600,
  "vehicle_description_used": "Skoda Superb",
  "retail_value": 8500,
  "trade_value": 7200,
  "market_value": null,
  "raw_response_id": "...",
  "licence_notes": "commercial_source_do_not_republish"
}
```

## Use cases

### 1. Evidence-backed valuation summary

Generate a draft valuation evidence section that lists each source, date, mileage and value. Engineer confirms final wording.

### 2. Variance review

Flag if valuation sources differ materially.

### 3. Mileage sensitivity

Show how the valuation changes if mileage is verified, estimated or disputed.

### 4. Historic trend support

Auto Trader Historic Valuations and trended valuation capabilities may support historic market position where licensed.

### 5. Audit defence

If a valuation is challenged, CE can show which source was used, the input mileage/date, and the value retrieved.

## Implementation

- Do not scrape websites where APIs/licensing are not approved.
- Store raw API responses in controlled storage.
- Store parsed values in queryable tables.
- Keep source attribution and licence restrictions.
- Attach valuation evidence to case record and engineer pack.

## Controls

- Engineer owns final valuation.
- The system should not auto-select the highest value as final without human confirmation.
- Valuation source names and values may be commercially sensitive; protect access.
- Keep versioned extraction and valuation rules.

## MVP

Start with manual import of valuation results into a structured table if API access is not yet available. That still creates a searchable evidence base and prepares the system for later API integration.
