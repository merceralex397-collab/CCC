# EVA Report Mining and Sentry Bulk Sync

## Concept

Use the Sentry/EVA API to retrieve released reports and turn them into CE’s internal historical intelligence dataset.

## Why this is high value

External datasets are useful, but CE’s own historic reports are likely the best source for:

- actual case types;
- engineer values;
- repair/salvage values;
- damage zones;
- report types;
- valuation adjustments;
- client/principal patterns;
- cycle time and report release dates.

The Sentry API guide says report retrieval follows a two-step pattern: retrieve the available reports list, then retrieve a specific report by ID. The guide also states that the API does not provide native batch endpoints and that batch processing must be implemented at the client/integration layer.

## Use cases

### 1. Build CE historical case lake

Download all released reports and normalise:

- registration;
- claim number;
- incident date;
- inspection date;
- report type;
- claim type;
- valuation fields;
- repair/salvage/financial fields;
- damage areas;
- parts list;
- report text where lawful and useful.

### 2. Same-VRM prior case search

Search historical EVA reports for same registration.

### 3. Valuation and salvage benchmarks

Use historical valuation/salvage fields as internal comparables.

### 4. Report quality analytics

Track missing fields, common corrections, supplementary report patterns and turnaround.

### 5. Model training/evaluation dataset

Use released reports as labelled outputs for extraction, classification and pack-generation evaluation. Keep engineer conclusions human-owned.

## Implementation

### Safe sync worker

```text
GET /Report/GetAvailableReports
for each id not already downloaded:
    GET /Report/GetReport?id={id}
    store raw response
    normalise fields
    emit audit event
```

### Sync metadata

- API response ID;
- released date;
- retrieval time;
- checksum of raw JSON;
- schema version;
- normalisation version;
- processing status.

### Batch controls

- refresh token as required;
- sequential mode first;
- small delay between requests;
- concurrency only after testing;
- retry 5xx with backoff;
- log every response.

## Data model

```sql
eva_report_raw(
  report_id,
  registration,
  released_date,
  raw_json,
  checksum,
  retrieved_at
)

eva_report_summary(
  report_id,
  normalised_vrm,
  claim_no,
  incident_date,
  inspection_date,
  report_type,
  claim_type,
  val_market,
  val_retail,
  val_trade,
  val_salvage,
  fee_net,
  fee_vat,
  fee_gross
)
```

## Controls

- Use a dedicated integration identity.
- Store secrets in a vault.
- Keep raw report data access controlled.
- Do not auto-generate final engineering conclusions from historic reports.
- Be careful using report text for model training; confirm privacy and contractual terms.

## MVP

Start by syncing only report metadata and valuation/salvage fields. Add report text, damage areas and parts lists after governance is confirmed.
