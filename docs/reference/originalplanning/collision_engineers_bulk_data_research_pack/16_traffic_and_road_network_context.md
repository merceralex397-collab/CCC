# Traffic and Road Network Context

## Concept

Use road network and traffic datasets to add context to incident location, inspection allocation, travel planning and management analytics.

## Data sources

- DfT road traffic statistics and count-point downloads.
- OS Open Roads for a high-level representation of the road network in Great Britain.
- National Highways open data services for strategic road network context.
- Geocoding/postcode datasets where licensed/available.

## Use cases

### 1. Engineer allocation and travel clustering

If physical inspections are required, use location data to cluster appointments by region, road network and travel constraints.

### 2. Incident location enrichment

If accident circumstances include a postcode or location, attach road type and broad network context.

### 3. Workload planning

Track instruction volumes by region, road type or distance from engineer base.

### 4. Forecasted bottleneck analysis

Combine open case locations and engineer calendars to identify inefficient travel patterns.

### 5. Claims environment context

For road-traffic incidents, classify location context:

- urban/rural;
- motorway/A-road/local road;
- junction proximity;
- high-traffic corridor.

## Implementation

1. Normalise addresses and postcodes from CE Document Mapper/EVA.
2. Geocode to approximate coordinates.
3. Join to OS Open Roads or road traffic count points.
4. Store road-context object in case enrichment.
5. Use only broad context unless precise geocoding is validated.

## Output example

```json
{
  "location_context": {
    "postcode_area": "CH49",
    "road_network_context": "local road / urban",
    "nearest_major_route": "A-road within 2km",
    "traffic_context_available": true,
    "confidence": "low_to_medium"
  }
}
```

## Controls

- Inspection address and incident location are often not the same. Keep these separate.
- Geocoding precision may expose personal location data; apply access controls.
- Do not use road context to make liability conclusions.
- Keep original address data minimised and permission-controlled.

## MVP

Use postcode sector or outward postcode only for management analytics, not exact address-level mapping. This reduces privacy risk while still supporting workload and regional insight.
