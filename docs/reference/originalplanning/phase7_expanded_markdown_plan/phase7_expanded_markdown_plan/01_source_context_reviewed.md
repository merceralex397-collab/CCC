## Public/official sources checked

These sources informed the integration and governance recommendations:

- Microsoft Graph change notifications / Outlook resources: supports subscriptions for message resources and event-driven intake patterns.
- Box API reference: confirms metadata instances, metadata templates, webhooks, retention/hold and file operations are platform capabilities.
- ICO AI and data protection guidance: supports the recommendation for DPIA, data minimisation, transparency, security and human safeguards where AI processes personal data.
- ICO DPIA guidance: supports carrying out DPIAs where processing is likely to result in high risk, especially with new technologies or systematic/profiling-style evaluation.
- OWASP API Security Top 10 2023: supports partner-API security controls around authorisation, authentication, excessive data exposure and object-level/property-level access.
